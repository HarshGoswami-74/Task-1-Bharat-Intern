## Introduction

The "Content Management Tool" is a basic web application for creating and managing blog content. It allows users to input the title, upload an image, and enter the content for their blogs. The information is submitted to a PHP script named `connect.php` for further processing.

## HTML Structure

The HTML code is organized as follows:

1. **Document Type and Head Section:** The document type declaration and head section contain metadata and references to external resources, such as fonts, CSS styles from "style.css," and a JavaScript file "script.js."

2. **Body Section:** The body section contains the user interface for the Content Management Tool, consisting of:
    - A modal container for displaying messages.
    - A form container that includes the following elements:
      - A title input field.
      - An image upload input field.
      - A content textarea.
      - A submit button to save the blog content.
    - A note container (empty in the provided code).

3. **Script Tags:** The HTML includes a script tag referencing "script.js," which is used to provide functionality to the page.

## Usage

1. Create an HTML file and paste the provided code into it.
